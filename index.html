      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey! Iâ€™m Maithily Bhala, a dual-degree student at IIIT Hyderabad, majoring in Computer Science and Geospatial Intelligence.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
        Iâ€™m someone who loves building thingsâ€”whether itâ€™s through code, design, or just good teamwork. I find myself just as excited solving algorithmic problems and writing clean backend logic as I am crafting intuitive user experiences or leading club initiatives. My coursework keeps me sharp (and yes, I genuinely enjoy it), but itâ€™s the balance of academics, creative expression, and hands-on project work that really energizes me.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
        Currently, I serve as the <strong>Head of Design at DheemiLocal</strong> and am part of the <strong>Design Team at E-Cell, IIIT Hyderabad</strong>, where Iâ€™ve worked on everything from campaign design to branding for large-scale events. But Iâ€™m not just about designâ€”I'm deeply into tech too, and have been part of multiple hackathons, coding projects, and collaborative builds that let me experiment with everything from networking to game dev.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
        Outside academics, Iâ€™m an active member of the <strong>Culturals</strong> and <strong>Ping! Magazine</strong> clubs, where I love contributing, organizing, and just bringing ideas to life. I enjoy working in fast-paced, creative spacesâ€”especially ones that let me manage, collaborate, and learn on the go.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
        When Iâ€™m not busy tinkering with code or design drafts, youâ€™ll probably find me sketching, capturing moody visuals, or putting together something cool for Instagram.
      </p>
